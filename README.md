## <span id="overview">Project Overview :memo:</span>

Stack of whole project including
[website project](https://github.com/botprzemek/basketball-website) - **CENN (CockroachDB, Express,
Nuxt, NodeJS)**

This documentation provides an overview of the REST API project developed for the Knury Knur√≥w
basketball team. The API is built around JavaScript (TypeScript :milky_way:) with Express :coffee:
framework (Node.js). It integrates technologies such as CockroachDB :cockroach: and Socket.IO
:satellite:, Node-Mailer :mailbox: and Node-Cache :eight_pointed_black_star:

Testing API instance running on [this link](https://api.testing.knuryknurow.pl/), please refer to
project's documentation about API endpoints

To run the project in development mode (Nodemon - Restarting after changes), execute the following
command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

To run the seeding script to fill your database, execute the following command:

```shell
npm run seed
```

To run the project in production mode (PM2 - daemonize app and logging), execute the following
command:

```shell
npm run server
```
